# DanShip
DanShip was taken in a real-life setting, capturing a mix of both natural and ship-radiated sounds that more accurately represent actual underwater acoustic conditions. The dataset consists of sound recordings of three distinct types of ships: fishing boats, cargo ships, and speedboats. 

Real underwater acoustic environments were recorded with two 8-element linear arrays of hydrophones deployed passively at a distance of 500 meters from each other, and with a high sampling frequency of 48 kHz. The ships included in the dataset belong to three different types and traveled along various routes and speeds. The ships were directed to travel within the 30-150 degree angle range of the two linear arrays. Additionally, we collect some additional data in a high-noise environment.

The obtained audio has a total duration of 83 minutes, with 8 channels in each of the north and south arrays. Here we present some data in DanShipSamples. The file format is `{id}_pos_{pos_idx}_ch{ch_idx}.wav`, where `id` represents the sequence number, `pos_idx` indicates the array position, and `ch_idx` represents the channel number. In addition, files with the `noise` suffix in their filenames are high-noise samples.
